0bliqueNinja: "Make the bigProfilePicture rotate through a subfolder of images for the selected character? A similar effect to the emotions feature in SillyTavern, but not mood related, and purely random? Even better, having subfolders for this character who's names appeared on the right and allowed you to specify a state and it chooses randomly from that folder. (e.g. have a idle, happy and sad folders, which appear as toggle buttons and govern which images appear, allowing you to have different states or different outfits.) Maybe it can swap after a random number of messages, controlled by configurable options. I'd love to get some subtle movement going to help my immersion when RPing."
"It'd be pretty straight forward as far as options. Have a folder named after the character in the Characters folder. Have it identify all of the subfolders in this folder and create a list of them on the right of the screen that function as toggle buttons. Have some config options that allow you to specific min and max values for how often it should trigger. (or use time if this is viable and have it swap every rand(max-min)+min seconds) at which point it chooses a random image from the folder selected. If no subfolders in the characters directly, and only images, ignore the toggle buttons, and just show a random image from the character. Pick a name? Oh no, Rand-e-motion?"
